# Welcome to Drinks MVP
I've kept the V1 Design of this project for posterity's sake, but the body styles have been altered to accommodate the new design.

## To Dos for Design V2
- [ ] Add Search Icon back into search input
- [ ] Make cta clickable (not just link) for add cocktail
- [ ] Hero card copy to be pulled from Airtable based on flag
- [ ] Update images/logos with attribution
- [ ] Turn this List Components into a component that accepts props

## Colors for Design V2
- Light Gray/White Background: #EFF3F4;
- Primary Blue Color: #377084;
- Dark Text: #222222;

## Known Issues
- Body background on /homeV1 is using the new background color for the new design.
