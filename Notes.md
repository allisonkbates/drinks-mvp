# Welcome to Drinks MVP
I've kept the V1 Design of this project for posterity's sake, but the body styles have been altered to accommodate the new design.

## To Dos for Design V2
- [ ] Connect everything to the new db
- [ ] Add Search Icon back into search input
- [ ] Hero card copy to be pulled from Airtable (maybe?)
- [ ] Update images/logos with attribution
- [ ] Turn this List Components into a component that accepts props
- [ ] Fix design of sliders to work better
- [ ] Mobile views
- [ ] Optimize Images for performance
- [ ] Better logging and error handling for fetching airtable data
- [ ] Add fallback image for cocktails
- [ ] If nothing in a list return empty state

## New Features
- [ ] For now, connect to Airtable of what we have in stock and check to see which cocktails have it.
- [ ] Link Drinks as "Variations"
- [ ] Single page view of each drink
- [ ] Be able to use custom form and post to airtable
- [ ] Add basic search functionality
- [ ] As part of list functionality - have it take in a new column that is a tag, so that it's easy to set those rules. This can still be done, so that we can duplicate Gin for Whiskey, etc.


## Colors for Design V2
- Light Gray/White Background: #EFF3F4;
- Light Blue for background patterns: #e4eff2
- Primary Blue Color: #377084;
- Dark Text: #222222;

## Known Issues
- Body background on /homeV1 is using the new background color for the new design.
